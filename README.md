Project Motivation :

Within the field of business management, there are a multitude of administrative tasks to be done - be it calculating employee bonuses, overtime and revenue. Importing and calculating all of this data using spreadsheet software is often too tedious and inefficient. In addition, to improve employeeâ€™s productivity, constant monitoring through calling or emailing is required, which adds to the burden of the employer.

Especially if a firm is sufficiently large, these kinds of menial tasks have to be done for every single employee and expense. Why waste time doing something so inefficient and unproductive, when your time could be spent on the more important things in life?
